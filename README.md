This project's goal is to replicate the homepage of Google.
This is my first project and is supposed to measure how far I can accurately replicate Google's homepage (its appearance and its functions) with the knowledge that I have today.
This does not mean that this project will remain static after having been done when I was still beginning.
 It will be changed down the line as I improve until I am content with how the page looks and functions.
Thank you for reading! Have a nice day!
